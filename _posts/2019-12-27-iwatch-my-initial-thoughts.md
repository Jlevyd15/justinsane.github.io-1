# 48 hour review: iWatch 5

I was gifted an iWatch 5 for Christmas. I've had my eye on the iWatch for awhile but I've grown more interested recently with features like longer battery life, swimming modes, cellular access, music, etc.

## Main Use Case - Exercising

My main use case for the iWatch is excercising. I'm active in endurance sports: long-distance running, triathalons, cycling, etc. The short battery life of previous iWatch versions was an obstacle. Because of that I opted for my Suunto digital watch. I could use GPS and record a 6-hour Half Ironman race.

### Other reasons I wanted an iWatch:

- extension of my iPhone, Mac, etc.
- 'de-tether' from my phone
- experience of learning a gadget that's growing in popularity
- monitor health (heart beat and rhythms, etc.) 

## Negatives:

- It took me awhile to warm-up to the digital format. I was partial to mechanical movements and still am. Some of the iWatch faces mimic traditional, mechanical watches. 

- 'Overly connected'. I shied awy from being 'always connected'. The iWatch has 'Do Not Distrub', 'Theather', and 'Silent' modes.

## Things to Explore

- If That, Than This (IFTT) recipes using my iWatch. 
- iWatch-focused apps
- bands (dress, casual, athletic)
