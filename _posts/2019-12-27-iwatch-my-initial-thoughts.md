# 48 hour review: iWatch 5

I was gifted an iWatch 5 for Christmas. I've had my eye on the iWatch for awhile but I've grown more interested recently with features like longer battery life, swimming modes, cellular access, music, etc.

## Main Use Case - Exercising

My main use case for the iWatch is excercising. I'm active in endurance sports: long-distance running, triathalons, cycling, etc. The short battery life of previous iWatch versions was a hindrance. Therefore I opted for my Suunto digital watch. I could use GPS tracking and record a 6-hour Half Ironman race.

Other reasons I wanted an iWatch:

- extension of my iPhone, Mac, etc.
- 'de-tether' from my phone
- experience and learn a gadget growing in popularity

## Negatives:

It took me awhile to warm-up to the digital format. I was partial to mechanical movements and still am.
