Our trip to the Rich Coast (Costa Rica) was part adventure, part relaxation. 

The tropical landscape included huge trees (go figure), bodies of water, monkeys, sloths, tons of different types of birds, and more.

A highlight was hiking in the jungle, both at sea level ([Manuel Antonio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuel_Antonio_National_Park)) and in the clouds ([Monteverde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monteverde_Cloud_Forest_Reserve)).

Speaking of the clouds, this suspension bridge meters above the jungle floor in Monteverde was great:

Below I'll jot down my thoughts on traveling in Costa Rica. ⚠️ I'm not an expert so please excuse my ignorance and lack of local knowledge.

## The Food

Rice and beans were expected and it made appearances on our table frequently. What I didn't expect was how flavorful it was.

My favorite local food was the fruit: Guava, mango, pineapple, bananas, and more. So fresh.

## Driving

We weren't shy driving around CR. The most stressful drive was navigating to our hotel through the night after almost 9+ hours of flying. 

The roads outside San Jose were mostly 2 lane highways. By the way, the term highway is used loosely here. Most stretches lacked lighting and shoulder lanes don't exist. It was stressful at first spotting locals walking, biking and scooting on the roadside.

I was told to keep the speed under 100 km/h (62 mph) and we'd be fine. I quickly realized that I was the slowest driver on the road as others passed, even on double yellow zones.

Driving around wasn't horrible. I'd rent a car again and would recommend others do the same. It made day trips, commuting to dinner, surf spots, and attractions simple.

Waze is a great app for navigating. It worked fine. Just remember to keep some Colones to pay tolls on some roads.

Also remember to account for traffic since road work is constantly happening to upgrade the developing infrastructure.

## Expenses

I expected Costa Rica to be less expensive than it was. For example, admission to Monteverde Cloud Forest was $25/pp (USD). More than Muir Woods in San Francisco.

Dinner off-resort in the popular beach town Jacko cost $17 USD for a Thai Curry dish. More than a typical Thai restaurant in San Francisco.

The point is that Costa Rica can be expensive.

## The People

Costa Rica is one of the safest Central American countries. The locals that we interacted with were extremely nice. Spanish was prevalent but most locals knew some English. 

## The Climate

The weather in December was great. While sometimes humid we missed all the rain except one evening (lasting just a short time). The temperature ranged between 70-85 degrees.

The water was warm so wetsuits weren't neccessary (Pacific Ocean). 

## Great Trip

Costa Rica is a great travel destination.

There's plenty of activities to partake in: 

- fishing
- boating
- diving
- snorkeling
- hiking
- kayaking
- bird watching
- ATV'ing
- horseback riding
- sunbathing
- surfing
- ziplining
- nature walks
- etc.

I'm happy to help recommend day trips, areas to stay, tips, etc. Get in touch.
